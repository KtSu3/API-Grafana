# API-Grafana
This code makes a request via API for a customer service chat via WhatsApp and a PABX telephone exchange. I collect the data, process it, and connect it with my database to insert it. After that, I display it on some dashboards in Grafana.

I use Docker to run it in a Linux container, and it loops with Cron.
